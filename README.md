### Description

This repository includes the files needed to run my Streamlit Web App for English Premier League (EPL) data. I am a huge fan of the EPL and I love staying up to date with the transfer window. One of the biggest things that happens in the EPL season is not actually a game; rather, it is the news of which players are going to which clubs. This fascination with transfers has led me to wonder what a player's Estimated Transfer Value (ETV) is.

ETV is approximately what a club would need to pay for a player if they were to purchase them right now. Using data from the [FootballTransfers]("https://www.footballtransfers.com/us/players/uk-premier-league") website, I was able to gather information on a player's ETV, Skill Level, Potential, and Position.

In order to visualize different relationships between the variables, I created this Web App.
